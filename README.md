# enforge.de

This repository contains the current status of the website enforge.de.

> The grand idea was to make the site as fast as possible. Go on, check it, I'll wait.

## Local development

I used my own two projects for building this site:
- [temingo](https://github.com/tillhoff/temingo) as static site generator
- [serve](https://github.com/tillhoff/serve) as local development webserver

The `Taskfile.yml` contains the used commands for them and simplifies development further.
> Before starting those tasks, check whether the paths work.
