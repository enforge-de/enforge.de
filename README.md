## Status

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0a82e4c1-88c1-4873-9ac3-c7e4e7647f2d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/enforge-de/deploys)

## Purpose

This repository contains the current status of the website enforge.de hosted at netlify.

## Local development

I used my own two projects for building this site:
- [temingo](https://github.com/tillhoff/temingo) as static site generator
- [serve](https://github.com/tillhoff/serve) as local development webserver

The `Taskfile.yml` contains the used commands for them and simplifies development further.
> Before starting those tasks, check whether the paths work.
